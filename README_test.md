### Third header for internal tests.

This is a  `inline-code` test. Also for `var = 3500` multiple words with spaces. A bit longer for the linebreak test
 `from pygame import everything`
newline and ` other` characters on a string beginning. Lorem Ipsum and all that.

Code lines:
```Python
a = 500
print("Hello World:" + str(a))
```

File end, last line.
