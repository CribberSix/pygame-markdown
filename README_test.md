# pygame-markdown 

A simple python package to render a Markdown file on a pygame surface. Support of `inline code` as well as *italic* and **bold** characters.
Three header types (h1, h2, h3), ordered and unordered lists,
If x > 50 then do soimething, if y <= 51 do something else. 

> quote blocks

and even

```
code blocks!
var = 500
if var == 5: 
    print(x)
elif var >= 4:
    print(5)
elif var <= 5:
    print(3)
elif var < var:
    print("error")
``` 

1. **The entire color scheme is customizable** as well as font, fontsizes and the size of gaps between lines and paragraphs.
2. Vertical scrollbar appears automatically if the text is bigger than the assigned area within the surface.



## Second header 
The following is a list.

- This is a test for unordered lists
- One of the `socks` is **code** 
- Who on *Mars* has a third sock?
- This is not what should happen when we have a linebreak of a listitem we have a linebreak of a listitem

### Third header for internal tests

This is an `inline-code` test. Also for `var = 3500` multiple words with spaces. A bit longer for the linebreak test
 `from pygame import everything` newline and `other` characters on a string beginning. Lorem Ipsum and all that.

Code lines:

```
a = 500
print("Hello World:" + str(a))
print("Hello World2:" + str(a))
print("Hello World3:" + str(a))
print("Hello World4:" + str(a))
```
