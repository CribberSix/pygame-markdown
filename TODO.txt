- BUG: Inline formatting is currently only recognized if a whitespace leads and trails the formatting characters.

- BUG: If a word is longer than a line, it does get rendered, but over the text area to the right.
    - Possible solution: separate word into characters, render chars until line-end is reached and skip to next word.
    - Possible solution: try to separate the word on other characters into multiple sub-words (e.g. check for hyphen)


- BUG: Code Block linebreaks when code is too long to fit.
    - Currently the code is not wrapped if it doesn't fit into one line
    - Code cannot be continued in the next line if the line is too long, otherwise it doesn't make any sense.
        - Possible solution: insert syntactic linebreak ?
        - Possible solution: vertical scrollbar on the code-window/overall?


- FEATURE: Link Binding (medium prio)
    - Syntax: If you want to know more [click here](www.link.org) or read more.
    - Possible solution: Implementation as a 'button' by checking if left click happened on the word?


- FEATURE: Code blocks should recognize language strings (medium prio)
    - FEATURE: Code highlighting for other languages besides Python

- FEATURE: Second level of identation in lists (ordered + unordered) (low prio)
- FEATURE: Overloading the format of a word with bold and italic at the same time (low prio)
