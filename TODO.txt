- BUG: Inline formatting is currently only recognized if a whitespace leads and trails the formatting characters.

- FEATURE/BUG: Code Block linebreaks when code is too long to fit.
    - Currently the code is not wrapped if it doesn't fit into one line
    - Code cannot be continued in the next line if the line is too long, otherwise it doesn't make any sense.
        -> insert syntactic linebreak ?
        -> vertical scrollbar on the code-window/overall?

- FEATURE: Second level of identation in lists (ordered + unordered)

- FEATURE: Link Binding
    - Syntax: If you want to know more [click here](www.link.org) or read more.
    - Implementation as a 'button' by checking if left click happened on the word?


- FEATURE: Code blocks should recognize language strings
    - FEATURE: Code highlighting

- FEATURE: Overloading the format of a word with bold and italic at the same time
